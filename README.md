# Starlet.js

Starlet.js helps you manage your bookmarklets with ease and grace!  Say goodbye to editing JavaScript in your bookmark manager.

## Installation

We'll probably make this a `npm` module.  All you need is node.js right now, so do the normal thing:

    npm install

## Usage

This is work in progress, but this is how it works right now...

    node starlet.js file1.js file2.js > bookmarks.html

Then `bookmarks.html` will have bookmarklets for "file1" and "file2".  You can either:

  1. drag and drop them to your bookmarks toolbar or
  2. import them with your browser's "import bookmarks" feature
